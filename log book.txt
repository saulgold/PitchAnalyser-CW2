trying to add record and play functionality by looking at  record play exampl app provided by mplab

23/4/16
-issues with intialising variables for loop, i and j keep getting -987 or random negative values
-tried initialisein them in the dma and seemded to work
-no sound kind of records but not properly...
-maximum audio storage is 30 lines of 128 length audio sample as a char, so using the g711 compression
-this increses possible length by 3 times.
-not sure how long this is.

-after klooking at the forums apararntly the libraiesfor writing to flash are incorrect
-found a correction by another user to the libraries so now trying that
-dosent work
-tried differrent way of accessing the eeeprom using drect spi communicaiton byut alsdo didnt work
- now trying different method.
-storing peaks from each frame rather than entire frame
-smoothing compabs signal with moving average
-testing differnce mask sizes - need to confirm technique workls porperly

-finding peaks in each frame using a length 5 mask using simple technique
-added record and play buttons
- was crashing
-so commented out smoothign section and worked fine with buttons
- wrong actually works with smoothing but not with peak finder!
-think issue is with not initiiaslsing peakFreq to zero
- sometimes just need to restart mplab *sigh
-memory issues with saving peak frequencies and not restarting the count at the right time i think
-for some reason initialising i and j in the dma makes them work better as counters i.e not nonsensical values
-finding too many peaks so need more smoothing
-somethign wrong with the peak freq storage device
